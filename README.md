The Third Project : This is similar to the second project, but the difference is that between this and my second, I started learning JavaScript, my first programming language. It took me a little while to get used to JavaScript because it was a lot different from HTML and CSS.

Because of this, I was afraid I would forget to write html and CSS, so I decided to copy another famous website, Instagram. Upon finishing the site, I realized that I had nothing to worry about, since it was so simple, and I could continue learning JavaScript without worrying about losing the knowledge I have gained from HTML and CSS. Although that didn't change the fact that my HTML and CSS coding for a few elements wasn't great. Since I had not yet learned about positioning and overlaying images, I made up for it by using negative margins on the overlaying image.

Overall, I am satisfied with the way it turned out and the way I made it.

This took me about 2 days to complete.
